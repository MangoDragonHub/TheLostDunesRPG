# TheLostDunesRPG
A Prototype Tabletop RPG that was made for class.

I wanted to make a MadMax-esqe RPG style game so I made The Lost Dunes where the Earth is enguled in sand and bandits roam the land.
This gives the players a lot more challenge to work with but also makes the game more linear as well to follow the plot.
